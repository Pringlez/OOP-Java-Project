Project Details
---------------
0. I've developed a GUI to demonstrate usage of the word cloud API, you can either parse a file or URL with this user interface. 
0. The application will generate the images in the same directory as the wordcloud.jar file.
0. Java docs are available if you need more information on specific classes or methods.
0. The URL parser uses jsoup to parse the words from web pages, it can be found here (http://jsoup.org/).

To Run the GUI
--------------
To run the java application, open a command prompt / terminal window. Navigate to the directory containing the 'wordcloud.jar' file and run the following command. Include the 'stopwords.txt' file in the same directory, you can also specific a different word ignore file in the GUI application.

```
java â€“cp ./wordcloud.jar ie.gmit.sw.Runner
```
### GUI Usage
I believe the GUI is fairly intuitive, you shouldn't have any problems using this interface I hope :)

#### File Parsing
When parsing a file click the 'Select File' button to select your file. Then select any settings on the left
hand panel if you wish, after just click the 'Generate' button to create the word cloud image.

#### URL Parsing
To parse a URL click the radio button 'URL' to switch parsing type. Enter a URL and again select any options on the left hand panel if need be, then
just click the 'Generate' button and watch the magic happen!

If any errors appear they'll show up in the top right hand corner of the GUI, full stack traces will appear in the console.
 
API Usage
---------
You can also directly interact with the classes to generate a word cloud image. 

### Code Snippet
```
Parse app;
		
app = new ParseFile("stopwords.txt", "fileparse");
app.parseWords("WarAndPeace.txt", 0, 50);
		
app = new ParseURL("stopwords.txt", "urlparse");
app.parseWords("http://www.bbc.com/news", 0, 50);
```

### ParseFile / ParseURL Class Parameters
* The first argument is the path to the word ignore file, I've included the 'stopwords.txt' as a sample file.
* The second argument allows you to specify the output file name of the generated word cloud image.

### Method 'parseWords' Parameters
* The first argument takes input from either the text file or URL, depending on what class parser you instantiate. 
* The second argument allows you to select the image option, 0 - for image size of 800 x 600, 1 - for 1000 x 800, 2 - for 1200 x 1000.
* The third argument allows you to specify the maximum amount of words to be used in the image generation.
